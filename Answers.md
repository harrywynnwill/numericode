0. Iphone... not dogmatic about it. They are more robust and survive the wear and tear I force upon them. I dont think much of the current offering and price - personalised emojis?! So maybe i'll leave the Apple faithful in the future.

1. A mix of good and bad.
   `Good` = Small team, pair programming, regular retrospection 

    Bad = Corporate one size fits all Agile with BAs, QAs and an obsession with Jira

    I would like a degree of autonomy and the `Good`

2. Do some philanthropy. Live on an island painting, coding and trading.

3. I gave the thumbs up on a pull request that put a date bug into the largest corporate payments platform - dates are very important in payments!! (We came up with a short term hack that avoided the release being pulled).

4. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

5. I have pair programmed for most of my coding career.

    I like the sound board to bounce ideas off.

    In coding, naming stuff is the hardest thing, I like that 2 people need to agree... so, it makes the code more readable.

    I like that knowledge isn't siloed in the team.

    I like that explaining something either concretes your understanding or shows holes in it!

    I dislike the disputes that can arise - you need humility (even when you know you are right).

    I dislike the feeling that you are moving slower than you could alone (sometimes).

    I dislike that some management consider it a waste of money.

6. It's better. Just as in 2 years time my code will be better than now. If it's not something has gone wrong.

7. I would like to see more trust given to developers to get the job done. The removal of the scrum master, BAs and potentially even QAs. Replaced by contact with the customers everyday - ideally co-located with them.

8. Investigate how the clerical error was made and rectify it... I think.

9. You have the chance to rewrite the Trussle tech stack - what technologies would you choose and why?
